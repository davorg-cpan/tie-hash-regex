NAME

  Tie::Hash::Regex

DESCRIPTION

WHAT IS Tie::Hash::Regex?

  Tie::Hash::Regex is a Perl module which extends the functionality of Perl
  hashes so that they can match regular expression keys.

HOW DO I INSTALL IT?

  Tie::Hash::Regex uses the standard Perl module architecture and can
  therefore be installed using the standard Perl method which, in brief,
  goes something like this:

       gzip -cd Tie-Hash-Regex-X.XX.tar.gz | tar xvf -
       cd Tie-Hash-Regex-X.XX
       perl Build.PL
       Build
       Build test
       make install


  Where X.XX is the version number of the module which you are	installing.

  If this doesn't work for you then creating a directory called Tie/Hash 
  somewhere in your Perl library path (@INC) and copying the Regex.pm file 
  into this directory should also do the trick.

  Since this has been published to CPAN,

      cpanm Tie::Hash::Regex

  will also install it for you along whatever dependency is not yet installed.

WHERE IS THE DOCUMENTATION?

  All of the documentation is currently in POD format in the Regex.pm file.
  If you install the module using the standard method you should be able to
   read it by typing

       perldoc Tie::Hash::Regex


  at a comand prompt.

LATEST VERSION

  The latest version of this module will always be available from CPAN.
